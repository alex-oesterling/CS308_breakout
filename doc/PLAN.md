### Breakout Variant
- When I was a kid, my first exposure to mobile devices was an iPod Nano which I got for Christmas.
One of the games which it had on it was Vortex, which was in the Game Assignment Document as
an example. I think the circular game environment is both an interesting concept and a bit too complex for
my current abilities as a programmer. However, I find the concept exciting, and 8-year-old me 
thought the game was both entertaining and challenging.
- Recently, there have been Breakout-style games where the player launches a stream of balls at an angle
and tries to break as many bricks as possible. Instead of "bouncing" the balls, you try to break as
many bricks as possible before all the balls exit the bottom of the stage. Each brick requires
a large number of collisions to break, but you are given an ever increasing number of balls per 
shot. This variant is interesting because it appeals to the modern mobile game trend:
instead of requiring careful attention (moving the bouncer to keep the ball in the air),
the player can just launch the balls and let them bounce without having to do anything.
